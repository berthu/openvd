% Choosing tire and vehicle model. In this case, the parameters are defined by the user.

% Choosing tire

TireModel.a3 = 5000;
TireModel.a4 = 80;

VehicleModel.mR0 = 2400;
VehicleModel.mF = 6000;
VehicleModel.mR = 10000;

% The System is completely defined once we atribute the chosen tire model to the vehicle object.

% Choosing simulation time span

T = 7;                      % Total simulation time [s]
resol = 50;                 % Resolution
TSPAN = 0:T/resol:T;        % Time span [s]

%%
% To define a simulation object (simulator) the arguments must be the vehicle object and the time span. The default parameters of the simulation object can be found in <api/Simulator.html Simulator>.

simulator = Simulator(VehicleModel, TSPAN);

%%
% Changing initial conditions of the simulation object

simulator.ALPHAT0 = 0.3;              % Initial tractor side slip angle [rad]
simulator.dPSI0 = 0.25;               % Initial tractor yaw rate [rad/s]
simulator.dPHI0 = 0.25;        % Initial articulation rate [rad/s]

%% Run simulation
% To simulate the system we run the Simulate method of the simulation object.

simulator.Simulate();

%% Results
%

g = Graphics(simulator);
g.TractorColor = 'r';
g.SemitrailerColor = 'g';
g.Frame();
g.Animation();
