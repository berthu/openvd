%
% The center of gravity of the tractor and semitrailer are located at the point $T$ and $S$, respectively. The front and rear axles are located at the points $F$ and $R$, respectively. $A$ is the articulation point and $M$ is the axle of the semitrailer. The constant $a$ measures the distance of point $F$ to $T$ and $b$ the distance of point $T$ to $R$. The distance of the articulation from the rear axle of the tractor is given by $c$. $d$ and $e$ are the distances from the semitrailer. The angles $\alpha_F$ e $\alpha_R$ are the front and rear slip angles, respectively. $\alpha_T$ is the vehicle side slip angle and $\psi$ is the vehicle yaw angle. $\delta$ is the steering angle.

% Este modelo  escrito na forma:
%
% $$ {\bf M}({\bf x}) \dot{{\bf x}} = {\bf f}({\bf x}) $$
%
% Where ${\bf x}$ is the state vector, ${\bf M}({\bf x})$ the mass matrix and ${\bf f}({\bf x})$ is the vector function. Therefore, a function that allows the integration of the system with an explicit mass matrix is necessary. In this package the _ode45_ function is used.
